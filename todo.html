            <li>Undo - Redo
                <p>
                    Currently, when someone hits undo, and then writes something, the items he erased are permanently deleted. 
                    Thus, a malicious user could erase all data, by using multiple undos and then writing something.
                    In later versions, undo &amp; write should create a branch, and keep the old items, so that they can be re-enabled later.
